### Deploy the model
Deploy the model using Azure Container instance so that other webservices can interact with the endpoint. Enable authentication so that keys are generated for authentication of other webservices

### Application Insights
Enable Application Insights using the python logs.py in GitBash and retrieve logs from the deployed service.
